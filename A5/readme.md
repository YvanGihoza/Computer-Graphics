Problem Statement:

	For the fifth assignment, we were to design a video game (MazeWorld). Which allows the player to interactively explore a 
  defined maze, the project was to give us experience with textures.
  
Design:

	I used the texture3 as a template since our project had some similarities, after understanding how it works that 
  I used a couple of functions from texture3 mainly, init_texture() and the block() functions.
  
Implementation:

	I first started by reading and saving the text file, after that my second approach was to draw the saved maze on 
  the platform and then the remaining part was the interactive one.
