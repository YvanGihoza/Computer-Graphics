Problem Statement:

	Our third assignment was to give experience on lighting, where using the Gouraud shading we were to create a background 
  surface. 
  
Design:

	 This project was different than everything we did in the past since there was a lot of math involved. 
   The normal calculation, calculating the vertices colorsâ€¦But after reviewing the surface and shading codes 
   I was able to have an idea of how the implementation was going to be like.
   
Implementation:

	My first approach was to draw a simple surface first and from there I had just to do step by step to finish. 
  The second step was to add the noise, then finally the calculations. I did one light first and then I did the second.
  The keyboard call back was the last one to be implemented since we did it in the previous assignment, so I knew what to do.
